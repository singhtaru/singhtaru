ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Taru Singhâ€”currently navigating the labyrinth of VIT Vellore (send snacks and debugging tips).

ðŸ’» By day, I wrangle code in Python, C++, and Java; by night, I wage war against CSS bugs and JavaScript quirks. I once convinced React to cooperate with me, so you could say Iâ€™ve seen things.

ðŸ§´ I created a skincare tracker because, letâ€™s face it, my code might break, but my skin wonâ€™t. Check out my digital skincare diary on GitHubâ€”because self-care includes exception handling.

ðŸŽ¨ When Iâ€™m not sketching the chaos of my mind, Iâ€™m binge-watching K-dramas. Fun fact: If every K-drama was a passport stamp, my soul would have a permanent residency in Seoul, plus a time-travel visa and at least three dramatic reincarnations.

ðŸ”— Stalk me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taru-singh-5495a6288/) (networking is just social stalking with consent).
